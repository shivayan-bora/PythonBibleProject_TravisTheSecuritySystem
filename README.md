# PythonBibleProject_TravisTheSecuritySystem

This is the fourth project from the course The Python Bible containing concepts of list data structure and conditional statements.

# Goal:
The project consists of a security bot which will have a list containing the list of users which have an access to the system. The security bot asks for name as an input. If the name exists, it will greet the user and will provide an option to the user to remove themselves from the system. If the name doesn't exist, it will provide an option to the user to add themselves to the system.
